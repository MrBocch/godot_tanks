currently stuck on how the tank will fire projectiles.

im thinking just have a bullet scene be added to the tree after press
fire button. does it matter where in the tree is added?
seems to work after i did that, can only add one bullet to the scene
"Can't add child 'bullet' to 'root', already has a parent 'root'"
do i need to use arrays?

lets try to get one to work how you want

wish i could visualize the tree at runtime 

have to pass in, the position of the tank to know were to instantiate this bullet 
could a marker3d node be usefull here?, seems its not updated with the tanks position
when moved. if i also have to add the movement code to the node then its pointless 
iho

ok this is not as easy as i thought it would be, maybe using the marker3d node
makes sense?
i can probably write a function that returns, the location of the barrel
at anypoint in time, but i would have to think a little.
I should do that instead of the marker3d right?

this is alot more difficult than expected but nothing i cant do.
